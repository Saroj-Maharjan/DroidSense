# Welcome to DroidSense!

## Note

After what feels like a million cups of coffee and endless debugging sessions, I'm beyond excited to unveil my very first open-source creation - DroidSense!

DroidSense isn't just your average Android device manager; it's your tech-savvy sidekick designed specifically for developers and testers! With DroidSense, managing all those ADB functions is about to get as easy as ordering pizza on a Friday night!
But remember, it's still a work in progress!

And the best part? By liberating the source code, I'm unleashing the power of collaboration! Together, we can all geek out, learn, and grow in the wonderful world of DroidSense development! 🚀🌟

DroidSense, built on Compose Multiplatform, boasts native compatibility across Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms. While
the executable is not yet publicly available, users can access the code by pulling it from GitHub and building it
themselves.

Between the relentless demands of a full-time job and a lively kid, any assistance is as precious as a hidden treasure
chest!

## Final goal

In the near future, you'll be able to manage all ADB functions through user-friendly interface.
